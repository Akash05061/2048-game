Kubernetes End-to-End Project on EKS with ALB Ingress Controller
This repository demonstrates the deployment of a scalable, production-ready e-commerce application using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and the AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALB Ingress Controller). The project encompasses the full lifecycleâ€”from provisioning the EKS cluster to deploying microservices and exposing them via an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

## Project Overview
This project guides you through setting up an EKS cluster and deploying a multi-tier e-commerce application with the following components:

Frontend: User interface for product browsing and cart management.

Backend: Business logic handling user authentication and order processing.

Database: Persistent storage for user data and transactions.

The AWS Load Balancer Controller integrates with Kubernetes Ingress resources to manage external HTTP traffic, providing secure and efficient routing to services within the cluster.
